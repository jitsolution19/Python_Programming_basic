# Write a program for arithmetic function  such as Add/Subtract/multiply etc 
Number1 = input('Enter first number : ')
Number2 = input('Enter Second number : ')
Sum = int(Number1)+int(Number2)
multiply = int(Number1)*int(Number2)
subtraction = int(Number1)-int(Number2)
print('The Sum of two number : ',Sum)
print('The multiplication of two number : ',multiply)
print('The subtraction of two number : ',subtraction)
